# Hi, Iâ€™m zaid. More commonly knows as zee or crayyy_zee

My main interests include internet surfing, watching youtube vids and exploring new stuff.

That last one is the thing that got me into python and every day I'm trying to learn something new about this amazing language and improving myself in coding it.

My current biggest project is my first discord bot named "ASH".
I have worked hard on developing it and will continue to do so for the time being.

I'm an 11th grader in college and studying computer science as a major as im a huge techie. 

If you are looking to collaborate with me, I am currently in need of a secondary developer who is skilled in the discord.py library to help me with my bot's economy system.
I am a very friendly and collaborative guy so you are 100% gonna have fun with me.
